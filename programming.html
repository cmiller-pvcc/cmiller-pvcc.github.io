        <h2>Chapter 5: Programming Algorithms & Software Testing</h2>
        <h3>Phases of computer program development:</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Phase 1: Understand the Problem</ol>
            <ol>Phase 2: Design an algorithm to solve the problem</ol>
            <ol>Phase 3: Write the program code in appropiate language based on the algorithm</ol>
            <ol>Phase 4: Enter the program and save</ol>
            <ol>Phase 5: Execute the program</ol>
            <ol>Phase 6:Test the program, find the errors and debug, then retest</ol>
            <ol>Phase 7: Document and evaluate the program</ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Programming structures:</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Sequential structure:Top-down execution</ol>
            <ol>Decision structures: if/then/else</ol>
            <ol>Iterative (looping):
                <ul>
                    <li>While loop: continue looping as long as something is true</li>
                    <li>repeat/until loop: continue looping until something is true</li>
                    <li>for loop: loop a given number of times</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Recursive structures:
                <ul>
                    <ol>Repeat a set of instructions as a subtask of itself</ol>
                    <ol>rrepetition continues until:
                        <ul>
                            <li>degenerative case. which is a termination condition, is met</li>
                            <li>(degenerative case is also called a "base case")</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Two clasic programming/database problems</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Sorting: Descending order/Ascending order
                <ul>
                    <li>Sorting numbers</li>
                    <li>sorting strings (in accordance with ASCII values)</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Searching: find specific data that meet a certain criteria
                <ul>
                    <ol>In database:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Filters: temporary search</li>
                            <li>Queries: search criteria are saved so they don't have to be recreated</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Two popular search techniques:
                <ul>
                    <ol>Sequential search: search from top  to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time</ol>
                    <ol>Binary search:
                        <ul>
                            <li>only works if data is SORTED first</li>
                            <li>start in middle, then go to half of that, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Two classic program goals:</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Efficiency: Program takes minimal time and/or resources</ol>
            <ol>Correctness: Program runs in expected ways and works for all expected conditions</ol>
        </ul>
        <h3>Software testing and verification</h3>
        <ul>
            <ol>Kinds of tests:
                <ul>
                    <li>Acceptance testing: Verifies if the whole system works like it's supposed to</li>
                    <li>Integration testing: Makes sure that that software components or functions are both working together</li>
                    <li>Unit testing: Making sure that every software unit does what it's supposed to do</li>
                    <li>Functional testing: Evaluates the functionality of an application or system by testing its individual features or functions</li>
                    <li>Performance testing: Tests how the software operates from different workloads</li>
                    <li>Stress testing: Tests how much it can take before it fails. </li>
                    <li>Usability testing: Tests how well customers can use the system</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Software testing is done to detect:
                <ul>
                    <li>Architectual flaws</li>
                    <li>poor design decisions</li>
                    <li>Invalid or incorrect functionality</li>
                    <li>Security vulnerability</li>
                    <li>Scalabilitiy issues</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <ol>Testing best practices:
                <ul>
                    <li>Continous testing (does testing early and often. This happens throughout the whole code lifecycle)</li>
                    <li>configuration management (organizations maintain test assets and track what software builds to test)</li>
                    <li>Servic virtualization (simulates the missing services or systems that are not completed. allows the team to test sooner)</li>
                    <li>Defect or "bug tracking" (measures and improves quality)</li>
                    <li>Metrics and reporting (allows team members to share status, goals and test results)</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
