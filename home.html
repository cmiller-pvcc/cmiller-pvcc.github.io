    <h2>U.S. Department of Homeland Security</h2>
    <h3>What is the Department of Homeland Security and what does it do?</h3>
    <ul>
        <ol>This program is an Executive Department that was founded on November 25, 2002. It was built to help the United States 
            enhance the way their security works. The main areas of interest that the U.S. wants to be more secure on are "immigration 
            and customs enforcement, emergency response to natural and manmade disasters, antiterrorism work, and cybersecurity". When 
            these tasks are moderated, then America will have a relatively safe homeland security.</ol>
    </ul>

    <h2>Breaking down each area of security</h2>
    <h3>1. Immigration and customs enforcement</h3>
    <ul>
        <ol>In order to protect the United States from illegal immigration traffic, they created a enforcement group called ICE (Immigration 
        and Customs Enforcement) to crack down on border security.</ol>
        <ul>
        <ol>Border Security: it is enforced to prevent all the different types of illegal movement of items into the country. Across the 
            seven thousand miles of border along the U.S., the average amount of people caught are "1,000 individuals each day".</ol>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <ol>This area of the department keeps increasing "technology, infrastructure, and staff."  As technology and staff increases in this 
        area, the safer and more protected United States will be. </ol>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Emergency response to natural and manmade disasters</h3>
    <ul>
        <ol>To help American citizens from any type of disaster, the government created this emergency response program. This team helps create more survivors and replenish resources to those in need. </ol> 
        <ol>The different areas that this department stays ready for are:<ol>
            <ul>
        
        <li>Improving a Unified Incident Command System</li>
        <ul>
            <ol>Used to create plans and achieve the goals.</ol>
            </ul>
        <li>Disaster Emergency Communication (DEC)</li> 
        <ul>
            <ol>makes it their priority to have communication and a plan to protect. This team also makes sure that the survivors have all the assistance they need.</ol>
            </ul>
        <li>Nuclear, Radiological, and Biological Prepardeness</li>
        <ul>
            <ol>has a system called "BioWatch" that can discover any sight of "aerosolized biological agents".  </ol>
            </ul>
        <li>Private Sector Preparedness</li>
        <ul>
            <ol>has a campaign that will help businesses sustain an appropriate amount of resources to keep the companies open for emergency situations. this well help Americans prepare and respond to disasters happening </ol>
        </ul>
        <li>Allocating Homeland Security Funding</li>
        <ul>
            <ol>In case of terrorism or disasters, the government has a certain amount of money that will help protect and recover from. </ol>
        </ul>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Antiterrorism work</h3>
    <ul>  
        <ol>This campaign uses technology and systems to find and stop terrorists before they cause damage. The four main goals that the government uses to prevent terrorist groups from happening include:
            <ul>
                <li>Research</li>
                <ul>
                    <ol>The government uses surveillance from all over the world to find any person who has bad intentions about harming the U.S.</ol>
                </ul>
                <li>Target</li>
                <ul>
                    <ol>After they find the possible terrorists, they have a protocol that they have to follow. This insists of contacting agencies to inform them of the info which will help organize a better plan to keep us all safe. </ol>
                </ul>
                <li>Protect</li>
                <ul>
                    <ol>One of the main objectives in these instances is to keep world leaders. All special government buildings will be protected if these threats happen.</ol>
                </ul>
                <li>Technology</li>
                <ul>
                    <ol>Technology is used to find and stop these terrorists. Some items used with the intent to stop terrorists include "drones, satellites, computers, sensors, and artificial intelligence".</ol>
                </ul>
            </ul>

        </ol>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Cybersecurity</h3>
    <ul>
        <ol>Because the whole world runs on technology, the cybernetwork needs to be stable and safe. The cyber security goal is to keep a low threat/vulnerability profile and strengthen the cyberspace. In order to achieve these goals, we must learn from previous cyber incidents and asses the abundant amount of risks. </ol>
    </ul>
